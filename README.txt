PYSWMM - Python Wrapper for Stormwater Management Model (SWMM)

Abstract:

The purpose of PYSWMM is to provide a friendly programming interface to SWMM5. Currently, the tool is setup to open and run a SWMM model using the SWMM *.dll (*.dylib). 

Goals:

Eventually the goal is to build in the ability to quickly pull data from the SWMM output and report files. Furthermore, to facilitate parameter optimization, the tool will provide a nice interface to manipulate model inputs (Hydraulic and Hydrologic components).

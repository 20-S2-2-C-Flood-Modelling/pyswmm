This module is the start of the Python Storm Water Management Model (PYSWMM) wrapper. The wrapper itself can be found in:

.../trunk/pyswmm/data/pyswmm.py

where, as of today, the compiled libswmm.dylib can be found in the 'Darwin' folder. 

a testing script (test.py) has been created which creates a pyswmm object giving the user two avenues of testing: swmmExec or swmm_step.
